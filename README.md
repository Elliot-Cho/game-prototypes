# Wayfinder Game Prototypes

This repo contains video game prototyping that is currently being actively worked on. These prototypes will transferred to the full game once enough progress has been made. The prototypes were created using Unity3D, and coded in C# with some serialized scripts in XML.

## Prototypes

The following prototypes are currently being worked on.

### Combat Prototype

This prototype models top-down grid turn-based combat. The combat prototype implements grid tiles, controllable entities, entity movement using optimal pathfinding algorithms, entity interaction such as damage-dealing and ability use, as well as environmental modeling such as terrain move costs, obstacle entities, and different terrain altitudes.

All artwork for this prototype is placeholder art, and has no bearing on the final art planned for the full game.

### Dialogue Prototype

This prototype models traditional RPG dialogue. Dialogue is implemented as a dialogue box with scrolling/typing text when an NPC is interacted with. Dialogue is stored in XML files and deserialized on runtime. The system implements variable dialogue based on player relation to the NPC, player personality type (modeled on two axes), player party members, and flagged variables. Dialogue also implements choice selection and the resulting branching dialogue.

All artwork for this prototype is placeholder art, and has no bearing on the final art planned for the full game.
