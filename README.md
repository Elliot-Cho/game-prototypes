# Wayfinder Game Prototypes

This repo contains video game prototyping that is currently being actively worked on. These prototypes will transferred to the full game once enough progress has been made.

## Prototypes

The following prototypes are currently being worked on.

### Combat Prototype

This prototype models top-down grid turn-based combat. The combat prototype will implement grid tiles, controllable entities, entity movement using optimal pathfinding algorithms, entity interaction such as damage-dealing and ability use, as well as environmental modeling such as terrain move costs, obstacle entities, and different terrain altitudes.

All artwork for this prototype is placeholder art, and has no bearing on the final art planned for the full game.

### Dialogue Prototype

This prototype will model traditional RPG dialogue. Dialogue will be implemented as a dialogue box with scrolling/typing text when an NPC is interacted with. Dialogue is stored in XML files and deserialized on runtime. The system will implement variable dialogue based on player relation to the NPC, player personality type (modeled on two axes), player party members, and flagged variables. Dialogue will also implement choice selection and resulting dialogue.

All artwork for this prototype is placeholder art, and has no bearing on the final art planned for the full game.
